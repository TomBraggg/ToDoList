# ToDoList
QA Project 2 - ToDoList

Introductions:
This project is a to do list using Spring boot, javascript html and css. In the following an explanaition of how to use the software will be given.

How to use:
Firstly launched the JAR file in the /todolist/todolist/target directory - this will run the backend of the application.
Secondly open the front end using visual studio code and run open the html file with a live server
Now you can use the website - Create a to do list which you can then associate tasks to. This is all easy to do, just remember when creating a task to put the to do list id of the list you want to associate that task with.

The database properties currently run the test H2 database - in order to use a permanent SQL database you will have to switch to the production properties. I have provided a SQL schema that needs to be run in the documention folder that needs to be ran before using the production properties.

Testing:
Thorough testing is written for the backend of the project including full unit and integration tests. All aspects are covered and the tests are fully comperhensive with 69 tests written achieving 97.7% coverage
